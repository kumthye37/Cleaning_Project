This Code Book describes the raw data, the variables and the transformations (using run_analysis.R) performed to obtain the required tidy data set.

1) Data (raw data)

Data Source -->"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". 

Details of data can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The raw data was downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2) Data sets are Unzip the downloaded zip file and under the .\getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset folder, data was divided into train and test data sets in the train and test folders respectively.

a) README.txt, features_info.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt

These are the common files applicable to both the train and test data sets.

README.txt contains general information about the experiment and the files in the data sets

features_info.txt contains descriptive information on how the variables (features) were obtained from the from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals

features.txt contains the list of descriptive names for the 561 variables this data set.

activity_labels.txt provides code and descriptive names to the activities experiment subjects performed.

b) \train\X_train.txt, \test\X_test.txt

Contains 561 columns of variable values from the experiment. There are 7352 and 2947 observations in train and test set respectively.

c) \train\y_train.txt, \test\y_test.txt

Contains single column recording the activity code experiment subject was performing when the observation was made.

d) \train\subject_train.txt, \test\subject_test.txt

Contains single column recording code of the subject performing activity when observation was made.

1.3) Exclusion

Data files in the Inertial Signals folders are not included. Only included those files required for this purpose and thus ignored.

2) Variables (in tidy data set)

The independent tidy data set created for the purpose of this assignment contains the average of each mean and standard deviation variable, for each activity and each subject. This data set is extracted from the merged test and train data sets and labelled with descriptive activity and variable names.

See features_info.txt for details on how the variables are derived from the experiment.

2.1) Descriptive (variable) names

There is no consensus on what constitute descriptive variable names (see course project forum: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-012/forum/thread?thread_id=86) and there is no naming convention defined in this assignment, the original descriptive variable names provided in features.txt will be retained given the following consideration:

i) to me, a fully spelled out column name eg. "mean time based body acceleration in X direction" is not more descriptive than "tBodyAcc-mean()-X". This is not a set of simple data where layman can understand the variables use by reading the column names directly (eg. Diagnosis vs Dx). Reader will need to go through features_info.txt to appreciate how the variables are obtained and in doing so, will understanding the short form descriptive variable names provided. 

ii) Long column name will increase typing effort and reduce readability.

iii) Often, we may need to perform validation by checking back on raw data. If column names are consistent, it will make cross reference easier.

On similar note, descriptive activity names in activity_labels.txt will also be retained

2.2) Mean and standard deviation variables

The data extraction process assumes only variables with names containing 'mean()' and 'std()' are variables of interest. Variables such as 'fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X', 'angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)' are left out. 

The difference in naming implies the source of data might defer (eg. mean that is computed from raw signal vs mean output directly from electronic component without raw signal, thus standard deviation cannot be computed). Thus, to maintain the consistency of data, only variables with names containing 'mean()' and 'std()' are included in the tidy data set.

3) Data Transformation

3.1) Preparation

All required data files (eg. activity_labels.txt, features.txt, subject_test.txt, y_test.txt, X_test.txt, subject_train.txt, y_train.txt, X_train.txt ) are placed flatly in the working directory.

3.2) Steps involve in the cleaning & tidy process

The following steps are performed in run_analysis.R. The script also requires dplyr and reshape2 R libraries.

a)Read "activity_labels.txt" into a data frame and rename column 1 and 2 to "Activity_ID" and "Activity_Desc" respectively.

b)Read "features.txt" into a data frame.

c)Read "subject_test.txt" into a data frame and rename column 1 to "Subject_ID"

d)Read "y_test.txt" into a data frame and rename column 1 to "Activity_ID"

e)Inner join "activity_labels" and "y_test" data frames using Activity_ID

f)cbind "subject_test" data frame into data frame resulting from step e.

g)Read "X_test.txt" into data frame.

h)Rename "X_test" data frame column names using descriptive labels from "features" data frame.

i)cbind X_test data frame with data frame from step f to create a complete descriptive test data frame

j)Repeat steps from c) to i) for the train data set to create a complete descriptive train data frame.

k)rbind complete descriptive test and train data frames to create full data frame.

l)Create data frame of required variables by subset the full data frame to only select "Subject_ID", "Activity_Desc" and variables with either "mean()" or "std()" in their names.

m)Melt the data frame of required variables by using "Subject_ID" and "Activity_Desc" as id to create a long data frame.

n)dcast the melt data frame from step m) using "Subject_ID" and "Activity_Desc" as id and "variable" as measured variables. Set "mean"" as aggregate function.

o)Use write.table with row.name=FALSE to write tidy data frame from step n into text file. Each variable has a column and each observation is a row.
